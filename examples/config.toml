[vault]
# Vault server address
address = "http://127.0.0.1:8200"

# Vault token with permissions to read/write secrets and metadata
# In production, use environment variables or secure secret management
# For local development with 'make vault-docker', use: "root"
token = "root"

# KV v2 mount point in Vault
mount = "secret"

# Default rotation period in months
period_months = 6

# Length of generated secrets (characters)
secret_length = 32

# Optional: Database configuration for PostgreSQL password rotation
# [database]
# host = "localhost"
# port = 5432
# database = "postgres"
# username = "postgres"
# # Path in secret backend for admin password (recommended)
# password_path = "admin/postgres-password"
# # Or provide password directly (not recommended for production)
